What is Youjuke?

Youjuke is a music forum that allows groups of visitors to compile a shared playlist and listen to it together, live. Anyone can add a track to the playlist, but it is up to all users as a whole to decide the order of the playlist. Whether you want to share tracks with a larger audience, or want to break out into a virtual party with friends, Youjuke has you covered.

Want to know which music the audience likes? Youjuke keeps track of the user's music preferences and favorite tracks. Want to have a virtual karaoke party while video chatting with friends? Just select the lyrics tab and sing away.

Let you be the algorithm to your listening party.
How do I use Youjuke?

    In this demo version of Youjuke, some tracks may already be in the playlist.
    First sign in, then click on 'Start Listening' to play the playlist. Search for a song, and click on it to add to the playlist.
    Want to hear that song you just added more than any of the others already in the playlist? Give that song a thumbs up to vote it to the top, and if that song has more thumbs-ups than the other tracks, it will come on after the current song.
    Hate a song in the playlist? Give that song a thumbs down. The most down-voted songs will appear at the bottom of the playlist.
    In this demo version, you have unlimited voting, but users will have limited votes per amount of songs that are added to the playlist.
    Want to sing along to the current song? The tab next to the search tab shows lyrics of the current song.
    The graph tab shows a chart that keeps track of music preferences of users.
    The star tab shows the most up-voted songs.
